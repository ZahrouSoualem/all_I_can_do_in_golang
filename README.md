# Recruiter Backend in Golang

## Overview

Welcome to the Recruiter Backend project â€“ a comprehensive Golang application designed for recruitment purposes. This project covers a spectrum of features, from basic CRUD operations for users to advanced authentication and authorization using JWT. We prioritize security with bcrypt password hashing and leverage SQLC for efficient PostgreSQL database interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang:** A performance-oriented language for robust development.
- **SQLC:** Code generation for PostgreSQL, saving valuable development time.
- **Migrate Package:** Effortless database migrations for controlled schema evolution.
- **PostgreSQL:** A reliable and scalable relational database system.
- **GIN Framework:** Widely adopted for generating RESTful APIs.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens ensure secure and stateless authentication.
- **Session Management:** Seamless and secure user experience with a session-based approach.

## Security Measures

- **Bcrypt Hashing:** Prioritizing user password security with bcrypt hash functions.

## Database Management

- **SQLC:** Efficient and maintainable PostgreSQL interactions through code generation.
